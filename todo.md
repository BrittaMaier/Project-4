- Read lecture handout on local storage
- update excalidraw file
- install use-local-storage-state package
- theme state (thats the colors state) needs to be saved in localStorage
- colors state needs to use state saved in localStorage as initial state

- import useLocalStorageState in app component
- exchange useState by useLocalStorageState when defining the colors state using "colors" as key to store state in local storage and initialColors as defaulValue
